## Running the tests

Run unit tests
```bash
npm run test
```
### Run in Docker

This app can also be launched in a Docker container.
Make sure youâ€™re in the directory `node-project-metrics/` in a terminal or powershell, and build your bulletin board image:
```bash
docker build -t node-project-metrics .
```

Running your image with -d runs the container in detached mode, leaving the container running in the background. The -p flag redirects a public port to a private port inside the container. Run the image you previously built:
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 -d node-metrics
```

Go to `http://localhost:8080` and you should see the app running locally.
