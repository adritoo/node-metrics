## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To build and run this app locally you will need Node.js

### Quick start

Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adritoo/node-metrics.git
cd node-metrics
```

Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

Populate database
```bash
npm run pop
```

Build and run the project
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Finally, navigate to `http://localhost:8080` and you should see the project being served and rendered locally.

### Run in Docker

This app can also be launched in a Docker container. Go to the directory that has your Dockerfile and run the following command to build the Docker image.
```bash
docker build -t node-metrics .
```

Running your image with -d runs the container in detached mode, leaving the container running in the background. The -p flag redirects a public port to a private port inside the container. Run the image you previously built:
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 -d node-metrics
```

Now open `http://localhost:8080` and you should see the app running locally.
